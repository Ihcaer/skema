# 1. Introduction: Project Context

Welcome to the documentation for **Skema System**. This section provides essential context, explaining the application's overall purpose, the technologies it utilizes, and how its components are structured.

Understanding these foundations is crucial before proceeding to the setup and development guides.

## 1.1 Project Goals

The system's core purpose is to completely separate the management tools from the user-facing experience, allowing for maximum versatility and scalability.

This is achieved by maintaining a clear separation of concerns between the user-facing interface, the administrative tools, and the core business logic.

## 1.2 Technology Stack

The application leverages a modern, containerized stack:

- **Frontend (Main):** `TBA`
- **Frontend (Admin):** Angular + PrimeNG
- **Backend (API):** Node.js + NestJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Object Storage:** MinIO
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose
- **Routing:** NGINX Reverse Proxy
